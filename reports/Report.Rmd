## Introduction

**Analysis of Online Course Analysis**
 During my Analysis I come across with many challenges. The online course is related with the secure payments. The main objective of the analysis was to uncover important  factors and to reveal indicators that will  keep the enrollments in growth rate and the  seminars be interesting from all the learners.
 The analysis is based on 7 sets of data. Each set consist of 7 files. These files are related with enrollments of learners and  activities that take place until the      completion of the course. The  course mainly consist of 3 sections. Each section has many activities that a learner need to attend and pass some questions.    

 The initial analysis is based mainly on the 4th set of data. After understanding the data of this set, i merge and the other set to have bigger historical data about the  course. The preparation of data was part of my analysis by removing all the records that can not give any value to my variables as they could be null. 


## Data Analysis
 During my analysis I tried to find some interested data that might help us to take some conclusions and actions about the course. First i try to understand the category  of people that can attend this course. I would interested about the age,gender,education level and as well if the trend of enrollment would be incremented.  Part of my   analysis was to find an indicator as to how engaged the learner is, and subsequently how likely they might be to drop out.
   
 With the 4th set of data I analyse the data from the below files:
 
 * **Enrollment**
 * **Activity**
 * **Question Response**
 * **Leaving the course**
 * **Videos**

## Report 1     AgeRange Vs Gender 
This graph shows the enrollments regarding the age_range  and  gender of the learners from the 4th set of data. We see that people from both gender  and especially from  age 18-25 and 26-35 are interested more in attending this course.  Male are interested more more than females. 


```{r}
   
  ga = ggplot(dfenrolment4, aes(x=age, y=n, group=gender)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=gender))+
  geom_point(aes(color=gender)) +
  labs(title = "Enrolments regarding age/gender", x = "Age-Range", y = "Number of Ocurances")
  print(ga)
  
```

## Report 2   Age vs EducationLevel
This graph shows   the education level  per age of the leaners.  Inside of every circle there is a number of learners who attend the course.Each age range has different color circle. The age with the highest count have  university degree and university masters is the age 26-35.Based on university degree and university masters the age 36-45 is the second highest with the count of people 28 and 21.The age 18 -25 also has a lot people in secondary with count 38 and university degree with count 36.The age >65 has the highest count of people in university doctorate and professional. The age <18 has the lowest count of people in secondary which is normal at this age.

```{r}
##graph of age vs highest_education_level
ggplot(data=dfageeducation4) + geom_point(aes(x=age , y=education  ,colour=age, size = 4 ))+
  geom_text(aes(x=age,label = n,y=education), size = 3)+
  labs(title = "Education per Age",
       x = "Age-Range",
       y = "highest_education_level")
```

## Report 3  Employment area of learners

This Pie chart shows the top 5 employment areas based on the data.Each color represents the employment's job.The ration from around from pie chart starts by 50. The first biggest employment area is the IT and Information services with number of people 97.Unfortunately the second employment's job is unknown we don't know what kind of job is, but has number of people 93. The teaching and education is the third highest job with 32 number of people. Lastly comes the Engineering and manufacturing with 22 people and the Public sector with 20.  

```{r}
##group the employment_area
dfemployment4pie <- enrolment4 %>%
dplyr::count( employment=enrolment4$employment_area, sort = TRUE) 
## keep the top 5 
dfemployment4pie <- head(dfemployment4pie,5)
## plot the top 5 employment area in Pie
ggplot(dfemployment4pie, aes(x = "", y = n, fill = employment)) +
  geom_col(color = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(label = n),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y")
```

## Report 4      Enrolments by gender vs country
On this graph, Bar Chart shows us  by gender top countries that are participating in the course. It is amazing the participation from so many countries that are interested in the course. These data are dispaly after cleansing of data  

```{r}
  ggplot(dfcountry4 ,aes(x = gender, y = n   , fill = country))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  # geom_text(aes(label = n), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Enrolments regarding gender Country",
       x = "Age-Range",
       y = "Number of Ocurances")


```

## Report 5   Top Detected countries  that participating in the course 
On this Bar Chart shows us the number of the enrollments based on the top  detected countries that participating in the course. The y axis is increased by 300 and each color represents the countries. Clearly that GB has the highest number of enrollments 1079. Secondly comes the IN with 347 and thirdly EG with 279.  

```{r}
## plot showing the top countries regarding that participating in the course
ggplot(dfcountry4CY ,aes(x = country    , y = n   , fill = country))+
geom_bar(stat="identity")+
 geom_text(aes(label = n), size = 3) +
 labs(title = "Enrolments regarding Detected country",
       x = "country",
       y = "Number of  Enrollments")

```



**Activity file**  
In this file can  extract some useful informationâ€™s regarding the learners who attend  activities. Useful information was the average time for completion of each section. If we see some learners that are still have activities that the duration was above the average time then we can send them a reminder or questionnaire for helping them to complete the course.

## Report 6   Activities on the 3 Sections 
Based on this graph shows us the number of activities on the y axis and the sections of steps on x axis. The y axis starts by 10000 number of activities.Is clearly that following the steps there is a decrease. The first section of step has the highest number of activities with number 25722 the second with 16941 and the third with number 11861. 

```{r}
## plot showing the number of trials in the 3 sections of activities
ggplot(dfsteps4 ,aes(x = stepcount     , y = n   , fill = stepcount        ))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  geom_text(aes(label = n,y=n), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Section  Activity",
       x = "Sections of  Steps ",
       y = "Number of Activities")
```

```{r}
g = ggplot(data=dfsteps44, aes(x=step, y=n))
g1 = g + geom_point() + stat_smooth(linetype=2) +
  xlab("Sections of  Steps") + ylab("Number of ativiries")
print(g1)
```


## Report 7  Step duration  for the activities
This graph shows us the duration of each step. The y axis shows the minutes and starts by 200 minutes and the x axis shows the steps set. Based on the graph the step 1 took more minutes to be completed than the other steps. The step 2 took 464 minutes which has the fewest minutes comparing with other two steps 1 and 3. 

```{r}
## plot showing the average time for each section to be completed 
ggplot(dfstepdurationinmin ,aes(x = step     , y = name  ,fill=step      ))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  geom_text(aes(x = step , label =name, y=name), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Steps Duration",
       x = "Steps set ",
       y = "minutes")
```

**Question Response File**


## Report 8     Quiz Response 
Analysis of data regarding the questions vs response
This graph shows us on each quiz section the true and the false answers for the quiz. The red color represents the false and the blue the true. On the first quiz section there are more true answers than false which is pretty good overall for this first quiz section. On the second quiz section there are more true than false answers but the range between them is small comparing with the first step. Unfortunately the third step has more false answers than true. This may give  an alert that may change some topics
```{r}
## group my data per section and response : correct/false answers 
dfQuestionresp4 <- Questionresp4 %>%
dplyr::count(quiz= str_sub(Questionresp4$quiz_question, 1, 1),response=Questionresp4$correct, sort = TRUE) 
## plot showing the correct/false answers per section 
ggplot(data=dfQuestionresp4) + geom_point(aes(x=quiz  , y=n  ,colour=response, size = 4 ))+
  geom_text(aes(x=quiz ,label = n,y=n    ), size = 3)+
  labs(title = "Question/Response Quiz",  x = "Quiz-Section ", y = "Number of Trialsl")
```

## Report 9    Age Vs Quiz response for failure response
This Bar Chart shows the incorrect answers per age.The y axis shows  the number of incorrect answers and starting by 100. The x axis shows the age range of the people. The age 56-65 and >65 has the highest numbers of incorrect answers. It's important to mention that the age <18 has the lowest incorrect answers with only 5 in all ages. 

```{r}
## group the set of wrong answers by Age
dfQuestionrespFalse <- DF_QuestionAnswerJoin %>%
dplyr::count(Age=  DF_QuestionAnswerJoin$age_range , sort = TRUE)
## plot the worong answer per age 
ggplot(dfQuestionrespFalse ,aes(x = Age     , y = n  ,fill=Age      ))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  geom_text(aes(x = Age , label =n, y=n), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Incorrect answerd Per Age  ", x = "Age Range ",  y = "No. Incorrect answers")
```




## Report 10  Providing students with better feedback on their progress
**Leaving Reason File**

```{r}
ggplot(dfleavingReason4 ,aes(x = LeftYear, y = reason  , fill = LeftYear , colour= LeftYear,size = 3   ))+
  #  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  geom_text(aes(x=LeftYear,label = n,y=reason), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Leaving Reason from Course",
       x = "Reason",
       y = "Year Left")
```





**Joining many Files**
By merge many sets of files I extract informationâ€™s about the trend of enrollments by year/month and the duration of the course. The history of the files help us to have more precise results in some analysis.

## Report 11  Enrolments Per Year 
This graphs gives us the trend of enrollment. it is important for the course to see if peoiple are interested in attending the course inorder to take actions.

```{r}
ggplot(dfenrolments ,aes(x = Enrolemts    , y = n   , fill = Enrolemts   ))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  geom_text(aes(label = n,y=n), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Enrolments By Year", x = "Year", y = "Number of Enrolments")
```


## Report 12   Duration of Enrolmengts 
Average duration of the course. 
```{r}
dfdataenroldurationall
```



## Evaluation
The findings from the  analysis gives some guidelines how the course program may be more interesting  and have more new learners. Having an estimation of the activity and the course duration , these will gives an alert message to gives more motivation or reminder  to learner to attend the course. It will also give more attention to people with older ages as they have bigger failure in activities. The topic of the course may be updated and enrich by analyzing  the leaving  reason of some learners.
