Also there are few non-binary and other which are not specify the gender. If you looked focus on the graph you can see that the females are more than males on every enrollment regarding on any age.

**Note:According to the ggplot geom_bar unfortunately the visualize of showing the color percentage of each bar based on gender on the age range is not match with the number's for the genders. But the number's of each gender are correct.     

```{r}
##Enrolments regarding age/gender
ggplot(dfg ,aes(x = age, y = n   , fill = gender))+

  labs(title = "Enrolments regarding age/gender",
       x = "Age-Range",
       y = "Number of Ocurances")
